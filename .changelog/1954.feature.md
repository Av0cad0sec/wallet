Pending transactions

Introduces a section for pending transactions within the transaction history
interface. It is designed to display transactions currently in a pending
state that are made within the wallet. The section will also show up in case
there is a discrepancy between transaction history nonce and wallet nonce,
indicating that some transactions are currently in pending state.
